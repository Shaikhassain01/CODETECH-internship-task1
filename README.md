Overview of the Project
Overview of Library Management System Database
A library management system helps in organizing and managing a library's book inventory, member information, and borrow/return transactions. Here's a summary of the database structure and the main SQL operations performed:

Database Structure
Books Table

Purpose: To store information about the books available in the library.
Columns:
book_id: Unique identifier for each book (Primary Key).
title: Title of the book.
author: Author of the book.
published_year: Year the book was published.
genre: Genre of the book.
quantity: Number of copies available in the library.
Members Table

Purpose: To store information about the members of the library.
Columns:
member_id: Unique identifier for each member (Primary Key).
first_name: First name of the member.
last_name: Last name of the member.
email: Email address of the member.
phone: Phone number of the member.
membership_date: Date when the member joined the library.
Transactions Table

Purpose: To keep track of borrow and return transactions.
Columns:
transaction_id: Unique identifier for each transaction (Primary Key).
book_id: ID of the borrowed/returned book (Foreign Key referencing Books table).
member_id: ID of the member who borrowed/returned the book (Foreign Key referencing Members table).
borrow_date: Date when the book was borrowed.
return_date: Date when the book was returned (can be NULL if not yet returned).
status: Status of the transaction (e.g., 'borrowed', 'returned').
SQL Operations

Retrieving Data

SQL commands to retrieve data from the tables:
Retrieve all records from Books, Members, and Transactions tables.
Retrieve books by specific criteria (e.g., genre).
Retrieve members by specific criteria (e.g., membership date).
Retrieve transactions by specific criteria (e.g., status).
Use Case Scenarios
